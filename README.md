✋ Welcome to the small open source world of my "Astral-Travel" mod, here you can download the latest release, beta versions, alpha versions, etc.

🔧 I made this github just to introduce you to the way of creating my mod, as well as just write down my whole path, but not about me now

🔮 In short, if this is your first time here, I'll tell you what this mod is about. Everyone has the right to think their own way about what the Astral is. In this mod, I show how I see the astral in my own way, of course adhering to the original concept of "Astral",

🧬 Only this "Astral" will be with its terrifying entities, objects, and the whole dimension, I hope you will like my mod, because this is the 2nd mod in a row (even consider the first one, because the last mod was not completed).

🇷🇺 I am a Russian programmer, so don't expect something majestic from me (if there are mistakes, I'm sorry)
